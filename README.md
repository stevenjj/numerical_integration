# Numerical Integration
Some short matlab scripts to demonstrate numerical integration properties of explicit and implict methods

Comparison of forward vs backwards euler integration:
````
run backwards_euler.m
````
Backwards Euler performed with Newton-Rhapson. Only f(t,y) is known and f'(t,y) is estimated.
